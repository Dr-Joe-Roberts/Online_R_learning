```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

 
```{r}
library(ggplot2) 
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
library(readr)
library(readxl)
library(RColorBrewer)
library(viridis)
```
 
 
# Now design your own palette and try it out! 
Design the best palette you can and send them to Li.   
You should probably make one just for discrete variables

Check:   

1) Are the colors easily discernable? 
2) Is the palette colorblind friendly?
