# Content
This repository has 14 activities: 

0) Very basics of R coding  
1) Data wrangling with dplyr and tidyr 
2) Formatting ggplots – faceting, scales, guides, and themes 
3) Design custom palette in R 
4) One-way ANOVA and the compact letter display 
5) What to do when ANOVA assumption fails 
6) Randomized block design ANOVA 
7) Multifactorial deign ANOVA and interactions 
8) Repeated measures ANOVA
9) Split field and nested experimental design
10) Correlation and linear regression
11) Polynomial curve fitting 
12) Logistic regression  
13) Proportions, contingency tables and enrichment 

The first three units focus on how to tidy data and make pretty plots.   
Units 4 - 9 focus on ANOVA and Tukey tests.   
Units 10 - 12 focus on regression. 

Formal math is kept to minimum. The series focus on basic concepts, interpretation and execution in R.   
Each unit builds upon the previous. After each unit, there is also an exercise. 

# Getting started
1) Clone the repository to your machine by downloading the zip file
2) Unzip (and move the “Online_R_learning-master” folder to whichever folder you like on your machine).
3) Open RStudio and create a new project: File - New Project. Select *Existing Directory*.
4) Set the folder directly containing "R_codes", "data" and "answer_keys" subfolders as the working directory. 
_Important! If you don't set the right folder, R will have trouble loading the data files._  
5) Open .Rmd files under the R_codes folder: File - Open File.
6) Under the Knit or Preview drop down menu, select *Project Directory*. 
_Important! This way R can load the data files._
